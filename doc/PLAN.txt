Plan:
    I found Super Breakout to be particularly interesting. In my opinion, it has the most similar taste
to the original Breakout game, which appeals to me. Additionally, it has various power-ups
that can boost your points, but also ones that can subtract points away if you hit them. This risk vs reward aspect,
along with the variety of additional effects such as multiple balls and laser paddles supporting the theme makes the
game particularly exciting and engaging, while also maintaining a level of challenge that other Breakout versions
seem to lack.

    I intend to make the first level relatively simple and straightforward. There will be a few solid lines of
bricks relatively high up away from the bottom paddle. As the game progresses, each level will become subsequently
harder. For example, the bricks will be placed closer towards the bottom near the paddle, requiring faster reflexes
by the player in order to react accordingly. There will also be fewer occurrences of beneficial power-ups and higher
occurrences of detrimental power-ups. The bricks themselves will become harder to destroy as discussed later on.
Some general ideas for stages are sketched below. "=" indicates a brick, and "." indicates empty space. The paddle is
"__". Dimensions aren't quite concrete, may adjust as necessary so play through is enjoyable based on my parameters.
Note that the sketches below are only for the first three stages, not all are pictured.

    There will be various types of bricks. For example, I will have a standard brick that breaks after a single
hit. Additionally, there will be other bricks that require several hits in order to break. This can range from 2-10
total hits accumulated. Additionally, some bricks when destroyed will drop the various power-ups, both beneficial
and harmful. The frequency of the various bricks will depend on the current stage.

    Power-ups can vary wildly, from dramatically improved brick clearing to severely hindering the ability to clear
the stage. The beneficial effects will be providing additional lives, shooting multiple balls from the paddle,
increasing the size of the ball, and increasing the size of the paddle. Detrimental effects will be decreasing total
lives, dramatically increasing ball speed, decreasing the size of the ball, decreasing the size of the paddle.

    Finally, there will be a couple different cheat keys for players to use. Pressing the "b" key will automatically
give the player an extra life. Pressing the "e" key will increase the paddle to fit the length of the bottom side,
making it impossible for the ball to fall through the bottom side. Lastly, pressing the "f" key will destroy all the
bricks on the current stage and proceed to the next stage.

    Something extra I plan to add is an extra object towards the bottom of the screen (above the paddle but below the
lowest level of blocks) that will occasionally, depending on the stage, spawn a different type of ball that the
player must avoid hitting with their paddle. When hit, the game would immediately become over since there are no extra
paddle lives. The balls generated by the object will hit the bricks but will not remove them. This will add a new layer
of complexity to the game as the player needs to react accordingly such that the player dodges these new balls that
are generated but must still hit the normal ball(s).
